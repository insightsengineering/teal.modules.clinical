Most of the modules in `teal.modules.clinical` use functions from the R package [tern](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern/) in order to produce their output.

Please see [`teal` gallery](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.gallery) and [TLG Catalog](https://github.com/insightsengineering/tlg-catalog) to see examples of `teal` apps with modules from this package.

## Installation

For releases from August 2022 it is recommended that you [create and use a Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_access_token_here")
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/teal.modules.clinical@*release")
```

You might need to manually install all of the package dependencies before installing this package as without
the `dependencies = FALSE` argument to `install_github` it may produce an error.

A stable release of all `NEST` packages from June 2022 is also available [here](https://github.com/insightsengineering/depository#readme).

See package vignettes `browseVignettes(package = "teal.modules.clinical")` for usage of this package.
