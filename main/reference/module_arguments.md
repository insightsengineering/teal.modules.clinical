## Value

a `teal_module` object.

## Details

- Although this function just returns `NULL` it has two uses, for the
  teal module users it provides a documentation of arguments that are
  commonly and consistently used in the framework. For the developer it
  adds a single reference point to import the `roxygen` argument
  description with: `@inheritParams module_arguments`

- Parameters with identical descriptions & input types to those in the
  Standard Template Arguments section are excluded to reduce duplication
  as each module function inherits parameters from its corresponding
  template function.
