# Introduction

##

Considering an expression, R usually evaluates it and returns its value.
Instead of focusing on the value, it is also possible to work with the **code**
which generated the **value**. This is where non standard evaluation, or NSE,
starts.
The function `substitute` is an important element of non-standard evaluation.
For instance, if we consider `a` defined such as `a <- 5`,
then the expression `a` returns `r a <- 5; a`, the `substitute(a)` returns
the code to obtain the value: `a`.

The principle on which relies `teal` is to:

i. generate expressions.
ii. return the result of the expression in the result panel of the app.
iii. return the corresponding code (or expression) with `Show R Code`.

The expression returning the displayed value must be reactive.
The information in the encoding in one hand and the filtering panel on the
other hand modify the expression and the displayed value. As so, teal needs to
work both on expressions and values and relies heavily on NSE.

The NSE is an advanced notion and mixing it with Shiny app development is a
source of difficulties:

- hindered efficient coding as the Shiny app must be run to check the good
  execution of the code.
- limited possibilities for testing.

As an alternative, it is possible to focus first on the NSE aspects in plain R,
and secondly, only once ready, integrate it in the Shiny App. Hereafter, are
few practical examples demonstrating how NSE works.
The choice was made to focus on `substitute`.

# Basic

## Principle

```{r, error = TRUE}
non_evaluated_expression <- substitute(expr = a + b)
non_evaluated_expression
eval(non_evaluated_expression)
```

What happened?

- `substitute` returns the code and not the value,
- it even does not try the code, therefore it is possible to return an
  expression which does not make sense (yet), for instance involving two non
  defined objects.
- If the values of `a` and `b` exist, the expression can run without error (below).

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 5
eval(non_evaluated_expression)
```

Now, the function name `substitute` is for a reason. Not only returning the
expression, it also **operates substitutions** of some terms within a given
expression.

```{r}
fun <- function(a, b) {
  substitute(expr = a + b)
}
non_evaluated_expression <- fun(5, -2)
non_evaluated_expression
eval(non_evaluated_expression)
```

What happened?

- the objects `a` and `b` exist in the function environment where `substitute`
  is called.
- the terms of the expression within `substitute` were replaced by the values
  of `a` and `b`.

Indeed, before returning the expression, `substitute` verifies if `a` and `b`
don't have any value existing in the evaluation environment. If so, values of
`a` and `b` are used in the expression.

It is also possible to use the second argument of `substitute`, `env`, an
environment (or a list) containing objects. If the expression submitted
in `substitute` has corresponding objects in `env`, the terms within the
expression will be substituted with provided values:

```{r}
non_evaluated_expression <- substitute(
  expr = a + b,
  env = list(a = 5, b = 5)
)
non_evaluated_expression
eval(non_evaluated_expression)
```

What happened?

- The environment in which the values of `a` and `b` were taken
from was directly declared within the `substitute` expression (argument `expr`)
and the values were substituted (argument `env`).
- `substitute` returned a non-evaluated expression, use `eval()` to evaluate it.

With a slightly more elaborated expression:

```{r}
non_evaluated_expression <- substitute(
  expr = plot(x = x, y = exp(x), main = text),
  env = list(x = 0:10, text = "A graph")
)
non_evaluated_expression
eval(non_evaluated_expression)
```

Note that:

- `x` as an argument name in plot has been preserved, while `x` as an
 object has been replaced.

## Replace an object name

In formulas, character strings are not accepted,
how to operate the substitution?

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Error expected:
plot_expr <- substitute(
  expr = plot(y ~ x, data = iris, main = text),
  env = list(
    x = Sepal.Length,
    y = Sepal.Width,
    text = "Iris, again ..."
  )
)
```


```{r, error = TRUE}
# Error expected:
plot_expr <- substitute(
  expr = plot(y ~ x, data = iris, main = text),
  env = list(
    x = "Sepal.Length",
    y = "Sepal.Width",
    text = "Iris, again ..."
  )
)
plot_expr
eval(plot_expr)
```

The object names have a special `name` _class_; `as.names` coerces a character
string to an object name (alternatively, `as.symbol` provides identical result):

```{r}
plot_expr <- substitute(
  expr = plot(y ~ x, data = iris, main = text),
  env = list(
    x = as.name("Sepal.Length"),
    y = as.symbol("Sepal.Width"),
    text = "Iris, again ..."
  )
)
plot_expr
eval(plot_expr)
```


## What with dataframe name?

Lets imagine a pipe-flavored expression, with `df` being the term
corresponding to the dataframe which should be substituted:
`df %>% plot(y ~ x, data = ., main = text)`.

The principle exposed above can work directly without addition. However,
`df` in the expression is then replaced directly by the value of the object
provided and not the expression generating the dataframe:
the pipeline is working but not humanly readable.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

short_iris <- head(iris)
plot_expr <- substitute(
  expr = df %>% plot(y ~ x, data = ., main = text),
  env = list(
    df = short_iris,
    x = as.name("Sepal.Length"),
    y = as.symbol("Sepal.Width"),
    text = "Iris, again ..."
  )
)
eval(plot_expr)
plot_expr
```

How can we replace the value by the expression generating this value?

That is pretty much the topic of the vignette: `substitute`.

```{r}
plot_expr <- substitute(
  expr = df %>% plot(y ~ x, data = ., main = text),
  env = list(
    df = substitute(iris),
    x = as.name("Sepal.Length"),
    y = as.symbol("Sepal.Width"),
    text = "Iris, again ..."
  )
)
plot_expr
eval(plot_expr)
```

## In a nutshell

- `substitute` is relevant when the expression needs to be modified.
  It takes 2 arguments:
    + `expr` the expression to be (eventually) substituted.
    + `env` the environment in which potential replacement value might be
    needed.
- If the replacement value should be slightly more special like:
    + an **object name** (like in formulas e.g. `y ~ x`) then, use `as.name` or
    `as.symbol`.
    + a **data frame** name (like `iris`) then, use `substitute`.

# `rtables`

## Direct use of `substitute`

The `substitute` approach can be used with the new `rtables` pipelines.

Lets prepare an example for reporting data from LB domain. The example is based
on the template `LBT01`; the target is to report in columns the lab test result
per study arm, as values (`AVAL`) and changes from baseline (`CHG`),
per analysis visit in rows.

The data can be prepared as follows:

```{r}
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)
library(tern)

adlb <- teal.modules.clinical::tmc_ex_adlb
adlb_f <- adlb %>%
  filter(
    PARAM == "Alanine Aminotransferase Measurement" &
      ARMCD %in% c("ARM A", "ARM B") & AVISIT == "WEEK 1 DAY 8"
  )
```


And the `rtables` expression is obtained as:

```{r}
rtables_expr <- substitute(
  expr = basic_table() %>%
    split_cols_by(arm, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
    split_rows_by(visit, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
    split_cols_by_multivar(
      vars = c("AVAL", "CHG"),
      varlabels = c("Value", "Change")
    ) %>%
    summarize_colvars() %>%
    build_table(df = df),
  env = list(
    df = substitute(adlb_f),
    arm = "ARM",
    visit = "AVISIT"
  )
)
```

The expression is valid ... :
```{r}
eval(rtables_expr)
```

... but not easily readable ...:
```{r}
rtables_expr
```

... but that can be arranged:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(teal)

#' Stylish code
#'
#' Deparse an expression and display the code following NEST conventions.
#'
#' @param expr (`call`)\cr or possibly understood as so.
#'
styled_expr <- function(expr) {
  styler:::print.vertical(
    styler::style_text(text = deparse(expr)),
    colored = FALSE
  )
}
#'
#' @examples
styled_expr(rtables_expr)
```


## `substitute` in a function

Moving further, `substitute` can actually be wrapped in a function, this way
the `rtables` pipelines are _programmatically_ obtained:

```{r}
rtables_expr <- function(df,
                         arm,
                         visit) {
  substitute(
    expr = basic_table() %>%
      split_cols_by(arm, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_rows_by(visit, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_cols_by_multivar(
        vars = c("AVAL", "CHG"),
        varlabels = c("Value", "Change")
      ) %>%
      summarize_colvars() %>%
      build_table(df = df),
    env = list(
      df = substitute(df),
      arm = arm,
      visit = visit
    )
  )
}
result <- rtables_expr(df = adlb_f, arm = "ARM", visit = "AVISIT")
styled_expr(result)
eval(result)
```

* The same results as before are obtained ...
* while, fine tuning is easier.
* For instance, the variable designating the study arm and the visit can be
  changed, which is an expected feature in teal module encoding panel.

```{r}
result <- rtables_expr(df = adlb_f, arm = "ARMCD", visit = "AVISITN")
eval(result)
styled_expr(result)
```

## Chain expressions in a pipeline

It is also possible to manipulate expressions, for instance, expressions
might be chained in a pipeline.

```{r}
#' Expressions as a pipeline
#'
#' Accepts expressions to be chained using the `magrittr` pipeline-flavor.
#' @param ... (`call`)\cr or object which can be interpreted as so.
#'    (e.g. `name`)
#'
pipe_expr <- function(...) {
  exprs <- unlist(list(...))
  exprs <- lapply(
    exprs,
    function(x) {
      x <- deparse(x)
      paste(x, collapse = " ")
    }
  )
  exprs <- unlist(exprs)
  exprs <- paste(exprs, collapse = " %>% ")
  str2lang(exprs)
}

#' @examples
result <- pipe_expr(
  expr1 = substitute(df),
  expr2 = substitute(head)
)
result
```

* Expressions can be arranged in a list, this way, it is possible to
  have **conditional** editing of expressions.
* In the context of `rtables`, layers enclosing `analyze` call handle `.stats`
  option. The lean expression should include the `.stats` option,
  **only when the default value is changed**.
* This is again an expected feature in teal module when rendering the code with
  `Show R Code`:

```{r}
rtables_expr <- function(df,
                         arm,
                         visit,
                         .stats = NULL) {
  # The rtables layout is decomposed into a list of expressions.
  lyt <- list()
  # 1. First the columns and rows:
  lyt$structure <- substitute(
    expr = basic_table() %>%
      split_cols_by(arm, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_rows_by(visit, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_cols_by_multivar(
        vars = c("AVAL", "CHG"),
        varlabels = c("Value", "Change")
      ),
    env = list(
      arm = arm,
      visit = visit
    )
  )
  # 2. The analyze layer which depends on the use of .stats.
  lyt$analyze <- if (is.null(.stats)) {
    substitute(
      summarize_colvars()
    )
  } else {
    substitute(
      summarize_colvars(.stats = .stats),
      list(.stats = .stats)
    )
  }
  # 3. And finishing with rtables::build_table.
  lyt$build <- substitute(
    build_table(df = df),
    list(df = substitute(df))
  )
  # As previously demonstrated, expressions can be manipulated and
  # chained in a pipeline.
  pipe_expr(lyt)
}
```

* First application with standard statistics:

```{r}
result <- rtables_expr(df = adlb_f, arm = "ARM", visit = "AVISIT")
styled_expr(result)
eval(result)
```

* Then with statistics specifications:

```{r}
result <- rtables_expr(
  df = adlb_f, arm = "ARM", visit = "AVISIT",
  .stats = c("n", "mean_sd")
)
styled_expr(result)
eval(result)
```

## Including pre-processing

Finally, it would also be possible to wrap several expressions into a single
function.

* For instance, the teal module generally includes a pre-processing
  section:

```{r}
rtables_expr <- function(df,
                         paramcd,
                         arm,
                         visit,
                         .stats = NULL) {
  # y is a list which will collect two expressions:
  # 1. y$data with the preprocessing steps.
  # 2. y$rtables the table layout and build.
  y <- list()
  # 1. Preprocessing ---
  y$data <- substitute(
    df <- df %>%
      filter(
        PARAMCD == paramcd &
          ARMCD %in% c("ARM A", "ARM B") & AVISIT == "WEEK 1 DAY 8"
      ),
    list(
      df = substitute(df),
      paramcd = paramcd
    )
  )
  # 2. rtables layout ---
  lyt <- list()
  lyt$structure <- substitute(
    expr = basic_table() %>%
      split_cols_by(arm, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_rows_by(visit, split_fun = drop_split_levels) %>%
      split_cols_by_multivar(
        vars = c("AVAL", "CHG"),
        varlabels = c("Value", "Change")
      ),
    env = list(
      arm = arm,
      visit = visit
    )
  )
  lyt$analyze <- if (is.null(.stats)) {
    substitute(
      summarize_colvars()
    )
  } else {
    substitute(
      summarize_colvars(.stats = .stats),
      list(.stats = .stats)
    )
  }
  lyt$build <- substitute(
    build_table(df = df),
    list(df = substitute(df))
  )
  y$rtables <- pipe_expr(lyt)
  # Finally returns y as a list with two expressions.
  y
}
```

It is now possible to modify the studied parameter (`PARAMCD`)
in addition to the study arm and visit variables names.

```{r}
adlb <- teal.modules.clinical::tmc_ex_adlb
result <- rtables_expr(
  df = adlb, paramcd = "CRP", arm = "ARM", visit = "AVISIT",
  .stats = c("n", "mean_sd")
)
```

The two expressions are consistent:
```{r}
styled_expr(result$data)
styled_expr(result$rtables)
```


The two expressions can be executed and return the `rtables`:
```{r}
result_exec <- mapply(eval, result)
result_exec$rtables
```

## In a nutshell

At this point, it is then possible to:

- generate `rtables` pipelines.
- chain expressions in a pipeline (e.g. `pipe_expr`)
- decompose a `rtables` pipeline to add **conditional** layers (e.g. `.stats`).
- group expressions into a single list and control both **pre-processing** and
  **`rtables` pipeline**.
